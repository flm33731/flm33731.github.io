		<p>The goal of Talents Empowered <a href="http://www.rebeccacmoody.com/talents-empowered.html">(TE)</a> is to empower people who demonstrate a great desire to serve and better those around them.</p>
		<p>We sponsor three different organizations across the globe. These organizations include: Amazima, Angel House Orphanage, and Hope Clinic.</p>
				
		<h3>Angel House Orphanage</h3>		
		<p>Talents Empowered provides funding for the Angel House Grassroots orphanage which currently houses, schools, and cares for <i>72 orphans.</i>
			Originally, it started as a small building with a big purpose. Since then, it has grown to five buildings including a school, dorms, a computer lab, and a hostel.  
		</p>
			
		<h3>Amazima</h3>
		<p> Amazima was formed by Kaie Davis and educates as well as houses <b>800 Ugandan</b> children. TE supports family mentors at Amazima, which are people who live with the students and act as "school parents."
		</p>
		<h3>Hope Clinic</h3>
		<p>Hope Clinic is a medical/surgical center in the small village of Nâ€™Zao, Guinea. Talents Empowered wholeheartedly supports Jon and Anja as they continue to aid their village and honor their friend</p>
